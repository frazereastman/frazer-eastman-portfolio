            large-scale quote and buy sites for big name insurance brands such 
            as SABRE, Arnold-Clark and IGO4. This role has: enabled me to 
            develop my skills in both the Vue.js and React frameworks; enhanced

            Doncaster, that has  been a key player in the insurance market for a

            (laravel) and Vue.js on client facing and legacy internal systems. 
            This role was pivotal for my early career progression and it gave me 
            key insights into the types of systems I can expect to see working 
            as a developer, as we were actively developing cutting edge client 
            facing solutions for numerous new insurance solutions, whilst 
            managing hugely complex legacy systems internally. My proudest 
            achievement in this role came when I was entrusted with a large 
            design file to parse, as well as being given full agency to develop 
            the front end of a new vehicle breakdown journey, despite having 
            only completed my University education a few months prior.`

            Sheffield to be with my long-term partner and decided I wanted to 
            challenge myself academically. As such I decided to complete a 
            Masters in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Sheffield. 
            This was an incredibly challenging time, as I was also working full 
            time, but I managed to push through and learnt a lot along the way.
            In particular, I was able to explore fields such as AI and data 
            modelling in much more depth than had been covered during my 
            Undergraduate degree and so my core knowledge base expanded 
            significantly. During this time and having moved to an entirely new 
            city, I was also keen to try and engage in some extracurricular 
            activities. This led me to the discovery of Korfball and the 
            incredible sporting community that surrounds it. I first played on 
            one of the University of Sheffield teams and remain an active player 
            today as part of the Sheffield-based Snakebite team. Another 
            non-academic role I held during this time was social media secretary 
            for the Board Games Society. `

            a first class degree in software engineering, I also pursued extra

            exciting path. I became a course representative, chaired the chess
