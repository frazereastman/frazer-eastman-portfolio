            large-scale quote and buy sites for big name insurance brands such
            as SABRE, Arnold-Clark and IGO4. This role has helped me develop my
            skills in both the Vue.js and React frameworks, has helped me learn
            how to manage my time whilst working remotely, and has given me 
            vital experience in working in small AGILE teams.`

            (laravel) and Vue.js on client facing and legacy internal systems.
            This role was pivotal for my early career progress as it gave me key
            insights into the types of systems I can expect to see working as a
            developer, as we were actively developing cutting edge client facing 
            solutions for numerous new insurance solutions, whilst managing 
            hugely complex legacy systems internally. My crowning achievement in
            this role was when I was given a large design file to parse and full
            agency to develop the front end of a new vehicle breakdown journey
            despite my post-university professional development journey having 
            begun a few months prior.`
