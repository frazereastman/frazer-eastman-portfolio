            large-scale quote and buy sites for big name insurance brands such
            as SABRE, Arnold-Clark and IGO4. This role has helped me develop my
            skills in both the Vue.js and React frameworks, has helped me learn
            how to manage my time whilst working remotely, and has given me 
            vital experience in working in small AGILE teams.`

            developer, as we were actively developing cutting edge client facing 
            solutions for numerous new insurance solutions, whilst managing 
            hugely complex legacy systems internally. My crowning achievement in
            this role was when I was given a large design file to parse and full

            in fields that I previously explored in much depth such as AI and
            data modelling. During this time I also again wanted to see what
            extra-curricular activities I could conduct and stumbled across the
            sport of Korfball and the incredible people that surround it, and I
            am still a very active player to this day. I also ran the social
